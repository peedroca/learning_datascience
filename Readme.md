# Learning Data Science

Become a Data Scientist with me! Let's explore datasets around the world wide web and analyze them to get some insights.
I'll start exploring some databases... As relational I create a simple use case using MySql, and I'll try apply the best use of architecture in this example. Each database orientad type I get some different use case and apply the techniques of analyse and development of system to create a ecossystem that can maintain the use case fully functional.

## How to execute use cases

Each use case have a step by step execution file in root folder. It's important you have the knowledge about:

- Docker
- Python
- Database Access (Relational and Not Only Relational)
